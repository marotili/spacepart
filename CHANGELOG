    - HasBoundary no longer has boundary_points in the interface. This has a fixed definition for
      all instances of HasBoundary.
    - Added Data.SpacePart.Edge module

0.1.0.0
    - Renamed Math.Geometry to Data.SpacePart.AABB
    - Renamed Data.QuadTree to Data.SpacePart.QuadTree
    - Added Data.SpacePart.QuadTree.query. Returns all elements that intersect a given boundary.
    - The inclusive nature of the boundary's min extent should take precedence of the exclusive
      nature of the max extent.
        Before this change many of the tests failed when boundaries of 0 area were involved. One case
        that did not work was constructing a quadtree containing elements of 0 area. This change
        corrected this.
        The tests all_elements_inserted_query_prop and element_bounds_query_is_element_prop stil
        fail if the element is of 0 area. 
    - Cannot create quadtrees with initial bounds of 0 area.
    - Removed requirement on elements being an instance of the Intersectable class. The only
      required instance is of Data.SpacePart.AABB.HasBoundary.
    - Changed package name to spacepart instead of data-spacepart. The last release of
      data-spacepart used a data based version number. This version number policy did not work well
      with the standard package version policy. 
    - Added some QuickCheck based checks. Run with test/run_verify
    - Cleaned up the module exports.

20090126.0
    - Initial release.
